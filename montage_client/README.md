Just a few notes:

- This whole crate is basically just queries as derived by [Cynic](https://cynic-rs.dev)
- You update the schema by runnin `scripts/update-graphql-schema.sh` in the root of the project.
- You can generate new queries easily by pasting the schema at `schema.graphql` into [the Cynic query generator](https://generator.cynic-rs.dev/)
