# This script runs once when a session ends (which we know because we started a
# new one.) If you want to know when a session goes over time, use
# `session_over_time` instead. Be aware that this is also currently called when
# a session is extended!
#
# available stuff:
#
# - `$1` is the session description
# - `$SESSION` is the json-serialized session

say "session ${1:-NO SESSION} ended"
